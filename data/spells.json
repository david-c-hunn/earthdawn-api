    "description": "This spell summons a spirit to inhabit and animate an object, altering the item's shape to give it ambulatory and sensory capabilities, and forming limbs, eyes, and other organs as required. The object retains much of its original shape and is still recognizable as such. The magician silently points at the target object and makes a Spellcasting (9) Test. If successful, a spirit is summoned which immediately takes possession of the object. The spirit provides the object's intellect, but the magician makes an Effect Test to determine the object's physical Attributes, allocating the Test Result among the object's Dexterity, Strength, and Toughness Steps. The gamemaster may exercise his discretion to decide which Attributes should have more or fewer Step Numbers allocated to them. Caelarion, an elven Nethermancer, successfully summons a spirit to inhabit a stone statue that he has procured for the purpose. His Effect Test roll is 16, which he allocates over the statue's physical Attribute Steps, as follows: DEX 9, STR 3, TOU 4. On review, the gamemaster rules that the statue should have a higher Toughness and Strength compared to Dexterity, and asks Caelarion's player to reallocate the Test Result. The player obliges, as follows: DEX 5, STR 5, TOU 6. The gamemaster may also set a limit on the object's Attribute Steps. For example, he might limit small objects such as brushes, combs, or daggers, to a maximum Attribute Step of 3, but allow larger pieces of furniture a maximum Attribute Step of 7. Likewise, he may decide that a minimum Attribute Step is in order for the object. Reviewing the Attribute Steps for Caelarion's animated statue, the gamemaster decides that the stone statue should have a minimum Toughness Step of 7. Taking into account this requirement, Caelarion's player rearranges the Effect Test and comes up with the following physical Attribute Steps for the object: DEX 4, STR 5, TOU 7. The gamemaster approves and the spell is complete. The summoned spirit is reasonably intelligent and can follow complex commands. Although it willingly obeys its summoner, the spirit is erratic and capricious; if it can possibly create mischief while still acting within the boundaries of its instructions, the spirit Area of Effect: 4-yard (2-hex) radius from point of origin Effect: WIL+4 T his spell alerts to the presence of intruders.

Once his comrades have been sensed, the magician knows the next target detected is unknown to him. Making an Effect Test does not prevent the magician from taking other actions that round--sensing is a Simple Action (see Actions, p.215). The magician may attempt to cast spells on a target that he has astrally sensed, even if he cannot otherwise see the target. Magicians use this spell for many different reasons. It is often cast to determine if an item or object has an astral presence, or to detect the presence of nearby entities or Horrors within astral space. A magician using Astral Sense to view a magical item can sense the item's magical pattern and would learn it was magical in nature. However, he would not gain any information about the item's history or learn any Key Knowledges.\n"

The bones of one or more non-sentient animals are used to construct a Bone Circle no bigger than the area of effect. The magician spends one hour per thread walking the circumference, scratching or tracing magical inscriptions and placing bones to form the circle's outline. After completing the circle, he touches the bones and makes a Spellcasting (9) Test. If successful, a bone spirit is summoned to live within the circle. The spirit is not very intelligent. It cannot leave the bone circle, but will take physical action against anyone attempting to enter or already in the circle. Some spells, such as Grave Message (p.174) and Spirit Portal (p.200), require the use of a bone circle. A magician may have a number of active bone circles equal to his Spellcasting Rank. Kicking away the bones and erasing the inscriptions is not sufficient to destroy a bone circleâ€”it just makes it more difficult to see the circle's outline and therefore avoid disturbing the spirit that dwells there. A Bone Circle can be dispelled, but the magician must touch the circle to do so, risking assault from the spirit. The bone spirit will not harm its summoner, but cannot otherwise be controlled.

The magician can summon more than one hound by weaving additional spell threads before casting the spell. Each thread woven after the first, to a maximum of six spell threads, summons an additional fire hound. The more hounds summoned, the greater the risk that the magician loses control of them. If he fails any Thread Weaving Test after the first, a number of hounds equal to the number of threads woven to that point appear and immediately attack the magician. The magician crouches on all fours and howls loudly, then makes a Spellcasting Test against the hound's Spell Defense, +1 for each additional hound. If successful, one or more large flaming hounds leap from the fire. The magician can mentally control the hounds as long as they remain within 4 yards (2 hexes) distance, although this requires his concentration. If the hounds move beyond this range, they act on their most recent instructions. The hounds disappear if killed or when the spell ends. Fire hounds resemble large dogs, standing more than four feet high at the shoulder, and bear a passing resemblance to gate and hell hounds. Their stocky, muscular bodies are covered with short dark-brown fur that seems to absorb light and rows of sharp teeth fill their jaws. A fire hound can easily tear a limb from a human or an elf.

If successful, a fiery spirit is summoned from the flames, appearing at the magician's behest anywhere within the spell's range.

The spirit only responds to verbal commands given to it by the magician while he is within 40 yards (20 hexes). At the gamemaster's discretion, issuing these commands may require the magician to speak the elemental language of fire (see Elemental Tongues, p.67). The flameshaw has wheels, but does not actually touch the ground. Instead, it travels a few inches above the ground and can rise as high as 100 yards (50 hexes) above the earth if commanded, rising 2 yards (1 hex) vertically for every 2 yards (1 hex) of horizontal movement. The flameshaw may be instructed by the magician as a Simple Action to run over an opponent, trampling him under its fiery wheels.

At dawn each day for a week, the magician spends half an hour inscribing a small design, using a drop of his own blood, on the weapon. He weaves the first spell thread at the end of the week. The magician then spends half an hour at dawn each day for another week, inscribing a scar of the same design on the character to be linked to the weapon. He weaves the last spell thread at the end of the second week. After all of the threads have been woven, a sympathetic link is created between the character and the weapon. The death of a character or destruction of a weapon destroys the link between them, causing both scar-design and weapon-inscription to fade away without a trace. Once the ritual is complete, the magician makes a Spellcasting Test against the higher of the target weapon's or character's Spell Defense. If successful, the designs glow brightly, then fade to their normal state. The link is now active. Anytime that the weapon is lost to the character, he may make an Effect Test against the weapon's Spell Defense. If successful, and the weapon is within the spell's area of effect, it moves to the character at a Movement Rate of 3. The character does not require line of sight to the weapon to retrieve it. Should the weapon need to make an Attribute Testâ€” for example, to break out of a cabinet (Strength) or slide along a narrow window-sill (Dexterity)â€”the character makes an Effect Test in place of the Attribute Test.\n"
