Positions of command require greater ability: the higher an adept’s Air Sailing Rank, the bigger the ship he can command or the higher the position he can fill within a ship’s crew. The adept makes an Air Sailing (5) Test to help propel an airship. If successful, he effectively takes the place of one crew member for each Result Level achieved. For an airship to stay airborne, at least 25 percent of the crew must make successful Air Sailing (5) Tests each hour. For example, an airship with a rowing crew of twenty needs at least five rowers to succeed at Air Sailing Tests to stay afloat. This might be an equivalent number, such as two rowers, one of whom achieved an Extraordinary Result on his Air Sailing Test (thereby replacing four rowers). If at least 50 percent of the crew make successful tests, the airship can maneuver at its current altitude, dive, or climb slowly in a straight line. If 75 percent of the crew are successful, the airship can speed up, maneuver while climbing, or perform aerobatics. A ship’s officers can use Air Sailing to enhance the ship’s performance and steer it through hazardous situations (see the Gamemaster’s Companion for more information)."

If successful, the animal takes a Neutral “live and let live” attitude toward him. The adept may make additional tests to further improve the animal’s Attitude, but must spend at least one week with the animal between tests, treating it well during that time. Each subsequent improvement requires an additional Result Level on the Animal Bond Test. Once the animal’s Attitude increases to Loyal, it willingly takes risks for the adept and expects appropriate rewards for doing so. (This is more easily accomplished for an animal than for a Namegiver friend. For example, all a dog really wants is lots of affection and enough food.) A Loyal animal will accompany the adept on adventures if he so desires, and is referred to as an animal companion. However, an animal will not maintain a better Attitude towards an adept than the adept shows to it. As a result, mistreatment, neglect, or abandonment can offset the talent’s effects, worsening the animal’s Attitude towards the character. This talent can only be used on non-sentient, natural creatures. It cannot be used to improve the Attitudes of Horrors, Horror-constructs, or sentient beings of any kind."

The adept can use this talent against a number of different opponents equal to his Anticipate Blow Rank each round.

When doing so, he does not add +2 to the Difficulty Number for physical attacks against that opponent (but still adds it to other Difficulty Numbers). Instead, he adds his Anticipate Blow Rank as a bonus to the first Attack Test made against the opponent that round. Anticipate Blow does not convey any additional attacks—the attacks used on the counterattack must be saved up.\n\nKrarg successfully uses his Anticipate Blow talent against two opponents, both of whom are yet to attack him. He decides to Reserve his Action until he is attacked, to profit from the Attack Test bonus Anticipate Blow provides. When the first opponent attacks him, Krarg interrupts, attacking his opponent instead. He would normally add +2 to the Difficulty Number of all of his actions when he takes his Reserved Action, but the Anticipate Blow talent negates this effect and gives a bonus to his first counter-attack. Krarg makes a Melee Weapons Test using his Standard Action as his first attack, and adds his Anticipate Blow Rank of 6 as a bonus to that Test. He then uses his Second Attack talent, but receives neither a bonus to the Test nor increases his Difficulty Number.

As he is using the talent to both juggle and attack, Blade Juggle uses a Simple and a Standard Action and causes Krarg 2 Strain that round: 1 Strain and a Simple Action for continuing to juggle, and 1 Strain and a Standard Action for the attack. Also, Krarg’s Physical Defense bonus is reduced to +15, as one blade is now gone. Later that round, Krarg is attacked in close combat by a dwarf.  The dwarf does not hit, due to Krarg’s high Physical Defense. Krarg compares the Blade Juggle Test result of 27 he noted earlier against the dwarf ’s Physical Defense—a hit. Because this is treated as a thrown attack, the dwarf may use defensive talents such as Avoid Blow to dodge the blade, but fails. Unfortunately, the attack is an Armor-Defeating Hit. Krarg determines damage as normal, adding his Strength Step to the blade’s Damage Step. His Physical Defense bonus now drops to 12 from the loss of another broadsword.\n"

The work must be carried out at a properly-equipped forge, using forge tools (p. 266) if working metal, or at a properly-equipped workshop, using appropriate tools if working other materials. A poorly-equipped workplace may increase the time required, or a well-equipped workplace may reduce the time required to use the talent, at the gamemaster’s discretion. The adept spends a number of days working equal to the armor’s or shield’s base Physical+Mystic Armor Ratings. At the end of this time, he makes a Forge Armor Test against a Difficulty Number equal to the item’s current Physical+Mystic Armor+9. If successful, the item’s Physical or Mystic Armor Rating is increased by +1—if an Armor Rating is 0, however, it cannot be enhanced and the other Rating must be improved. This process can be repeated up to a maximum of 3 Forgings, but the increase to a Rating cannot be higher than half the item’s base Rating, rounded up. The process also gets harder with each additional improvement, as the item’s current Armor Ratings increase, leading to ever higher Difficulty Numbers. Armor Rating enhancements last for a year and a day from the date of the last successful forging. Additional Forge Armor Tests can be made at any time to extend the duration to a full year and a day, even for armor or shields already enhanced to their limit. A Pathetic Result on a Forge Armor Test ruins non-magical items, and can even destroy magical items if the weaponsmith triggers the Rule of One. This talent can be used to enhance threaded magical armor and shields, however a Good Result is necessary for a successful forging. The services of armorers can be bought in only the largest cities, but the higher the bonus desired, the higher the cost (higher bonuses require a more experienced armorer). For non-magical armors, the three forgings cost 200, 300, and 500 silvers respectively.  For magical armors, the three forgings cost 300, 500, and 800 silvers respectively.  (these costs cover any failed attempts, but will not insure against ruined items).\n\nKrarg has appropriated a nice suit of crystal ringlet armor and wants a Weaponsmith to improve it as much as possible. Both Physical and Mystic Armor Ratings are 4. He decides to have the Physical armor forged twice, and use his last forging to increase the Mystic Armor.  The sum of these unimproved Ratings determines the time one attempt takes: at least eight days work per attempt, twenty-four days in total for the three forgings—assuming every Test succeeds and the Weaponsmith does not insist on a day off. The Difficulty Number for the first Forge Armor Test is 17 (4+4+9), and every successful forging will add another +1. Krarg needs to find a really experienced smith, because he does not intend to spend weeks waiting while an amateur has to make retries— nor does he want to risk his armor getting ruined! After all, he will be paying good money for the work: 1,000 silver pieces (200+300+500).  If Krarg’s crystal ringlet was a threaded item, each forging would require a Good Result to be successful and cost a total of 1,600 silvers (300+500+800).\n"

His game group uses yards in this situation, so he simply multiplies his Test Result by two: 16 hexes equal 32 yards, and his Movement Rate is 12 yards (24 yards if Running).

The adept adds his Moving Earth Rank to the Mystic Armor of anyone riding on the earth section and all passengers add +3 to their Physical Armor. Once the section is in motion, the adept must concentrate to control the direction and speed, or to stop and start its movement. If his concentration is broken, the earth section stops moving and the talent ends."

The adept can read maps, chart courses, and even guide an airship safely through the skies, circumventing storms and turbulence, flying creatures, and other hazards. To pinpoint their location, navigators must be able to see the sky and must possess a set of navigator’s charts. Navigation most often means relying on the constellations of the Passions, the movement of the sun, and similar astrological phenomena for direction. Most maps have the constellations drawn around their borders for use with Shantaya’s sextant and similar navigational tools. Consequently, navigation is most effective on clear nights when the stars shine brightest. The adept spends ten minutes determining his current position and makes a Navigation Test against a Difficulty Number determined by the gamemaster, based on the Navigation Table, but modified depending on the circumstances. Incomplete or inaccurate charts increase the Difficulty Number by +1 to +5. The Test Result determines the adept’s accuracy. An Average Result gives a position accurate to within 10 miles; a Good Result yields one accurate within 5 miles; an Excellent Result, within 2 miles; an Extraordinary Result places the navigator within a mile of his target location. On a Poor or worse result, the adept becomes lost (see Getting Lost, below).\n\nGetting Lost\nOn a Poor Result, the adept inadvertently plots a destination 20 to 25 miles wide of his intended destination. He only recognizes his mistake if he makes another Navigation Test that yields a better result or arrives at the destination and realizes that it’s not the place he intended to travel to.

Should this happen, the adept dies and his spirit is doomed to wander astral space. The adept may end his Netherwalk at any time once his spirit has re-entered his body.

    "description": "The adept contacts a local elemental spirit to find the safest path through unfamiliar territory. The adept does not conjure the elemental, he only establishes contact. Unless the adept knows the elemental’s language (see Elemental Tongues, p. 67), the spirit communicates by using “sign language,” utilizing its native element to produce simple, but effective, signals for the adept to translate. Sometimes the elemental animates a part of the nearby landscape, making its conversation “audible” to other characters. The adept makes a Safe Path Test, the result being the number of miles of safe passage the elemental can predict. The elemental communicates the safest path to take and indicates possible elemental dangers or natural beasts along the way. Keep in mind that what an elemental considers “dangerous” can be vastly different to what poses danger to a Namegiver. The elemental’s knowledge of an area is also limited by its type. For example, earth elementals know very little about flying or waterborne dangers, but may be able to describe the arms and armor carried by other adventuring groups within the talent’s effective distance. The information relayed by the elemental does not indicate the intentions of other characters or creatures, merely their presence and whether the elemental “thinks” they are dangerous. Also, the adept is not guaranteed to make contact with an elemental—if the gamemaster determines an elemental is not present in the vicinity, then the talent has no effect."

Regardless of its summoned form, a spirit mount always has the following statistics:\n\nSpirit Mount\nDEX: 6   STR: 7   TOU: 8\nPER: 4   WIL: 4   CHA: 5\nInitiative: 7   Physical Defense: 8\nActions: 1   Spell Defense: 6\nAttack (1): 7   Social Defense: 7\nDamage:   Physical Armor: 0\nTrample (2): 9   Mystic Armor: 0\nDeath: 44   Recovery Tests: 4\nUnconsciousness: 36  Knockdown: 8\nWound Threshold: 13  Movement: 10\nPowers: Great Leap T (2): 8, Sprint (3)"

    "description": "Versatility is a racial talent, available only to human adepts (see Versatility, p. 21). A human adept with Versatility Ranks may learn talents from Disciplines other than his own, paying the same Legend Point cost as a member of that Discipline would to gain those talents. The adept must be trained by a member of the appropriate Discipline for each talent that he learns, something that many Disciplines do not always encourage their members to do. Training time and cost are determined by the gamemaster when learning from a gamemaster character, cost and time involved can get as high as training to advance to a Circle equal to the Circle the tutor learned the talent at. An adept may learn a number of talents from other Disciplines equal to his Versatility Rank. An adept cannot learn a talent from a Circle greater than his highest Discipline Circle. For example, if the adept’s highest Discipline Circle is Third Circle, he can learn talents from other Disciplines available to them at Third Circle or lower. As Talent Options can be learned at a range of Circles, they use the Circle the tutoring adept chose them at to determine if a human could learn them via Versatility. For example, a Novice Talent Option learned at Seventh Circle only can be learned by a Seventh Circle human adept, even if the tutor could have learned it at Second Circle. Talents learned through the use of Versatility are never Discipline Talents. Also, the Versatility talent itself, and talents learned through use of the Versatility talent, do not count toward the requirements for advancing to a higher Circle (see Advancing Discipline Circles, p. 239). This means that adepts who consistently use Versatility to learn and improve talents from other Disciplines will generally take longer to advance through their own Discipline Circles. An adept cannot use Versatility to learn talents available to his own Discipline as Discipline Talents, but can learn talents available to his Discipline as Talent Options. For example, a Second Circle Archer cannot learn the Anticipate Blow talent from a Warrior, as Anticipate Blow is a Third Circle Discipline Talent for Archers, but could learn the Warrior’s Avoid Blow talent, despite having potential access to Avoid Blow from his Talent Options. By using the Versatility talent, human adepts may learn Thread Weaving and Summon talents other than those for their current Discipline. For example, a human Wizard could learn and improve Ranks in the Elementalism variant of Thread Weaving, and therefore learn how to cast Elementalism spells. See Human Versatility and Spellcasting, p. 132, for more information on how the Versatility talent applies to magicians and magic."
